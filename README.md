The user gets to the main page. A stop loss/limit is set up with some default information that he can change.

The user also inputs the amount of fake money in $MXN that the bot will work with.

With a click on the start button the bot will begin to work.

Functions of the work:

- While in continuous contact with Binance API. On an abrupt rise in price in one of the coins listed on Bitso, that movement in price will trigger an event.

- The event created by the strong move in Binance will make the bot fetch the information of current sell price and sell quantity to simulate a buy of the currency.

- The information of the simulated buy will be displayed on the main web page. The web will display "# of trade", date, time, price that the user payed, quantity of the currency, equivalent to price, current price offered if you want to sell, % of win/lose of the transaction and a button to end the transaction.

- Once the simulated buy is done, the stop loss/limit will be working and fetching information in bitso to know if the price reaches the stop limit. Also displaying the current price to the user and modifying the % win/loss.

- At the end of the table a summary of the transaction is displayed for the user to know how much money has been made/lost in what amount of time, etc.

- At the bottom of the web page a crypto calendar is displayed so the user can look for important information in the crypto world.
